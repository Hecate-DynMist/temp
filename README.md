# Abstract
6D pose estimation is the task of detecting the 6D pose of an object, which include its location and orientation. This is an important task in robotics, where a robotic arm needs to know the location and orientation to detect and move objects in its vicinity successfully. This allows the robot to operate safely and effectively alongside humans. The awareness of the position and orientation of objects in a scene is sometimes referred to as 6D, where the D stands for degrees of freedom pose.
